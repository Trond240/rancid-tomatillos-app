Rancid Tomatillos is an application that allows users to browse movies, log into the server, rate movies, and view additional details about each movie. It is a showcase of our team's ability to work with progressively more complex React component structures. We used redux as a global store to minimize prop drilling and practice data management for large scale applications. We use React Router to navigate between pages and testes all of our synchronous and async functionality.
